It’s often thought that philosophy begins and ends with abstract and rational thinking. 

一般的看法是哲学始于抽象和理性思考，终于抽象和理性思考。

Like science, it’s seen as a methodology of logic that allows the philosopher to be detached, disengaged, free from the irrationality and subjectivity of emotion, and precise in the pursuit of objective truth. 

与科学，哲学被视为逻辑方法论，允许哲学家超脱、脱离非理性和主观的情感，精确低追求客观真理。

However, the history of philosophy shows that disruptive emotions and moods are central to the experience of philosophising.

然而，哲学史显示破坏性的情感和心境是哲学体验的核心。

Philosophy means love of wisdom. It includes a care of the self, and our attitude towards the world is extremely important for wellbeing.

哲学意味着对智慧的爱，包含自我关怀，我们对世界的态度和身心健康都非常重要。

Perplexity, wonder, surprise, estrangement and existential anxiety are some of the disruptive moods that spark philosophical reflection.

困惑、惊奇、惊讶、疏远 和 生存焦虑都是引发哲学思考的破坏性情绪。

​	 For example, it is often the case that in the grief following the death of a loved one, we find ourselves asking philosophical questions: *What is it all for? What does it mean to exist?*

比如，在亲人离世之后，我们经常会问自己一些哲学问题:   这一切意味着什么，存在的意义是什么?

There is a pattern in the history of philosophy that allows us to identify moods as the trigger that calls for and sustains philosophical reflection. 

在哲学史中，有一种模式能够让我们识别情绪作为触发和维持哲学反思的因素。

Although not every philosopher is inspired by a disruptive mood, many of them are. 

尽管并非所有哲学家都受到一种破坏性情绪的启发，但他们中的许多人确实如此。

Plato’s Socrates speaks about himself as being perplexed and lost. 

柏拉图笔下的苏格拉底说自己困惑迷茫。

Michel de Montaigne writes about the melancholia, deepened by the death of a dear friend, through which he came to philosophy.

蒙田在书中写到一个挚友的离世加深了她的抑郁症，正是这种情绪将他引向哲学。

 René Descartes’s methodological doubt emerged out of a sense of insecurity experienced in the disruption of his Catholic taken-for-granted beliefs.

笛卡尔对方法论的怀疑源于他在天主教根深蒂固的信仰遭受到动摇时所体验的一种不安全感。

 Karl Marx’s politics meant he was alienated from conventional ways of being-in-the-world.

Karl Marx 的政治观点使他与传统的世界存在方式格格不入

 Søren Kierkegaard’s anxiety led him into the world of philosophical reflection (‘all existence makes me anxious,’ he once wrote).

索伦-克尔凯郭尔的焦虑使他进入了哲学思考的世界(他曾经写道: "所有的存在都让我焦虑")

 Friedrich Nietzsche writes of the relationship between his emotional pain and his philosophy. 

你菜写道了他的情感痛苦和哲学之间的关系。

While Martin Heidegger does not write of his own anxiety, much of his thinking arose in response to a disillusionment with technology and modernity. 

虽然海德格尔没有写他的焦虑，但他的许多思想都是对技术和现代性幻灭的回应

Max Weber experienced the depression of a disenchanted world.

韦伯经历了一个失意世界的萧条

Different moods disclose and frame the world in different ways. In the mood of perplexity, Socrates becomes attuned to an understanding of virtue, while Plato sees wonder as the horizon of metaphysical thinking; wonder, for Aristotle, is the basis of enquiry into what is. 

不同的心境以不同的方式揭示和构建世界观。在困惑的心境中，苏格拉底开始关注对美德的理解；而柏拉图视惊奇为形而上学思考的起点，对亚里士多德而言，惊奇是对事物本质探究的基础。

In a mood of disenchantment, the Romantics launch their great project of re-enchanting the world, and the Marxists take alienation and estrangement to be the revolutionary basis for the liberation of workers from the capitalist class.

在失望的情绪中，浪漫主义者启动了重新赋予世界魔力的伟大项目，而马克思主义者则认为异化和疏离是工人阶级从资本家阶级解放的革命基础。

 Kierkegaard understands his own profound anxiety as the trigger for moving beyond the finite to the world of possibility. 

齐克果将自己的深刻焦虑视为超越有限世界、进入可能性世界的触发器。

Nietzsche shows us that the anguish of nihilism leads to the re-evaluation of all values, while Heidegger finds a different lesson in anxiety, taking us beyond the ‘average everyday’ ways of being to an ‘authentic’ attunement to being.

尼采向我们展示了虚无主义的痛苦如何引领对所有价值的重新评估，而海德格尔则从焦虑中汲取了不同的教训，带领我们超越"平凡日常"的存在方式，达到了对真实存在的"真实" 的调和。

 In general, existential philosophers see the mood of the anxiety of meaninglessness as throwing us into the [scary and exciting](https://aeon.co/essays/to-feel-the-awe-of-living-learn-to-live-with-terror-and-wonder) question of meaning.

总的来说，存在主义哲学家认为，无意义的焦虑将我们抛入意义这个既可怕又令人兴奋的问题中。

By emotionally disrupting the familiarity of our everyday world, these moods of disruption allow us to step back, to question, to make sense of that world in new ways. 

通过在情感上打破我们日常世界的熟悉感，这些破坏性的情感能让我们后退一步，提出疑问，以新的方式去理解这个世界。

The familiar world becomes explicit to us – no longer presumed but provoking – and we can question the ways of our being in that world. 

我们熟悉的世界变得清晰，不再是想当然，而是引发我们思考我们可以质疑我们在世界中存在的方式。

When we engage in philosophical questioning, we are questioning the way in which we make sense of our own existence, the existence of others, and our relationships to them. In reflecting philosophically, our way of being in the world is at stake.

当我们用哲学进行质疑的时候，我们是在质疑自身的存在，他人的存在以及我们与他人关系的方式，我们在世界中的存在方式岌岌可危。

Plato’s [allegory of the cave](https://aeon.co/videos/orson-welless-psychedelic-1973-adaptation-of-platos-timeless-allegory-of-the-cave) illustrates just this kind of disruption. He asks us to imagine a group of prisoners chained to the floor of a cave since infancy. 

柏拉图的洞穴寓言恰好展示了这种破坏，他要让我们想象一群从婴儿开始就被锁在洞穴地板上的囚犯。

They can look only straight ahead, since their chains prevent them from turning around. 

他们只能直视前方，因为锁链使他们无法转身。

The things that pass by the entrance of the cave behind the prisoners cast shadows on the wall in front of them. 

在囚犯身后洞口经过的事物在他们面前的墙投下阴影。

All they’ve ever known are the shadows: they assume, naturally, that what they see is the real. This is their familiar, everyday world.

他们所知道的一切都是阴影： 他们自然而然地认为，他们所看到的就是真实的，这就是他们熟悉的日常世界。

Then the chains of the prisoners are removed – the searing disruption of their lives.

然后囚犯身上的锁链被解开, 这是对他们生活的彻底颠覆(原文为searing disruption 灼热破坏，这里取了更符合中文表达习惯的翻译)。

For the first time, they can turn around and see what is behind them: the light at the entrance to the cave. 

他们第一次可以转过身来看到身后的东西: 洞口的光。

Now they can see that the images that they once took to be real are just the shadows of objects – not the objects themselves. 

现在他们可以看到，他们曾经认为是真实的图像只是物体的阴影，而不是事物本身。

They begin to be able to make a distinction between the image of things and the physical reality of things.

他们开始能够区分事物的影像和事物的物理实体

Their whole sense of what is real is disrupted. They are perplexed and confused, and experience the uncertainty of not being able to take their usual way of seeing the world for granted. 

他们对真实的整个感知被打破了。他们感到困惑和迷茫，经历着无法将他们通常的世界观视为理所当然的不确定性。

For some of the prisoners, this creates too much anxiety, and they want to return to the familiarity of their old ways of being in their cave.

对于一些囚犯来说，这让他们产生了太多的焦虑，他们想要回到洞穴中旧有存在方式的熟悉感中。

Others, however, are not only afraid but excited by what they are beginning to see behind them. It is still unfamiliar and strange, but it is exciting too. 

然后，也有一些人不仅没有感到害怕，而且对他们开始在身后看到的东西开始兴奋。它仍然陌生又奇怪，但也令人兴奋。

They are willing to embrace the journey into the strangeness of the unfamiliar. 

他们愿意拥抱进入陌生领域旅程。

We can call this simultaneous experience of excitement and anxiety ‘anxietment’. Such ‘anxietment’ is the mood in which philosophical reflection starts to take shape.

我们将这种兴奋与焦虑并存的体验称之为"焦虑兴奋"。这种“焦虑兴奋”就是哲学反思开始成型的情绪。

In the state of ‘anxietment’, the former prisoners approach the entrance to the cave. They are in for another surprise: they begin to see that they were in a cave all along. 

在焦虑兴奋的状态下，曾经的囚犯靠近洞口。他们还有另一个惊喜：他们开始意识到自己一直处于洞穴之中。

When they were in the cave, they could hardly know that it was a cave they were in. It is only as they come out that all becomes clear.

当他们在洞穴里面的时候，他们几乎不可能知道自己身处洞穴之中，只有当他们走出来，一切才变得清晰。

This points to the distinctive nature of philosophical reflection: it is less about observing the shadows that are projected onto the wall of the cave and more about becoming attuned to the background context in which the shadows are situated. 

这揭示了哲学反思的独特本质: 与其说是观察投射到洞穴影子，不如说是适应影子所处的背景环境。

To see our cave is to notice the unstated assumptions, conventions and habits that shape our observations and day-to-day interactions with the world.

看到我们的洞穴就是要注意到塑造我们观察和日常世界互动的未言明假设、惯例和习惯。

**Different philosophers have different understandings** of the background context to which we become attuned when, through embracing moods of disruption, we begin to venture outside the cave. 

不同的哲学家在我们拥抱破坏性情绪、开始冒险走出洞穴所适应的背景语境有不同的理解。

For example, for Marx, workers in their day-to-day activities are not aware of how their way of being is shaped by capitalism and the historical material conditions of existence. 

例如，对马克思来说，工人在日常活动中并没有意识到他们的生存方式如何被资本主义和历史物质条件所塑造。

Alienation is the mood of becoming emotionally dissociated from the world of work such that workers can see how their way of being at work is shaped by the relations of production in capitalism. 

异化是一种情感上脱离世界的情绪，使工人们能够看到他们在工作中的存在方式是如何被资本主义的生产关系所塑造的。

For Heidegger, when we are absorbed in our average everyday ways of being-in-the-world, we do not even know that our way of being is shaped by average everyday customs and conventions. 

对海德格尔来说，当我们沉浸在日常的普通存在方式时。我们甚至不知道我们存在的方式是由日常的普通习俗和惯例所塑造的。

It is only through existential anxiety that we are emotionally abstracted from our everyday engagements in the world such that we become attuned to the background conventions and ways of doing things that had shaped our way of being-in-the-world. 

只有通过存在的焦虑，我们才能在情感上从日常世界参与中抽象出来，从而对那些塑造了我们在这个世界上的存在方式的背景惯例和行为方式保持敏感。

‘Only when the strangeness of what-is forces itself upon us,’ he writes, ‘does it awaken and invite our wonder. Only because of wonder, … does the “Why?” spring to our lips.’

他写道:"只有当存在的陌生感强加于我们时,它才唤醒并邀请我们的惊奇。只因为惊奇,……'为什么?'才会从我们嘴里蹦出来。"

When we are struck by wonder, the language of the question to be asked is not yet formulated. It gets formulated as we stay in the surprise and mystery of wonder. As Heidegger says, the ‘why’ question emerges through the mood of wonder.

当我们我们被惊奇所震撼的时，我们还无法用语言来表达要问的问题。只有当我们沉浸在惊奇所带来的惊喜和神秘感的时候，问题才逐渐成形。正如海德格尔所说:  正是通过惊奇的情绪，为什么"这个问题是通过惊奇的情绪出现的。

Psychologists and psychotherapists know this point well. Clients come into therapy because they are experiencing moods that they cannot easily put a name to.

哲学家和心理学家都熟知这一点，来做治疗的来访者正在经历一些难以命名的情绪。

Working through the feelings of anxiety and depression offers clients the opportunity to name the experience and develop the language with which to enquire into the self. 

通过焦虑和抑郁的感受，来访者有机会为这种经历命名，并发展出探究自我的语言。

This process of formulating questions takes the skills of working through moods, learning to listen to what Eugene Gendlin calls the ‘felt sense’ of a mood – the sense that something is not quite right, disturbing us even though we cannot quite say what it is.

这个提出问题的过程需要处理情绪的技巧，学会倾听 尤金-詹德林(Eugene Gendlin)所说的情绪中的"感觉" -- 感觉到有什么东西是不对劲的，尽管我们说不清楚，但我们还是会感到不安。

The challenge for philosophical and psychological reflection is to develop the sensitivity to identify the particular mood of disruption and the world that is opened through the felt sense of that mood. 

哲学和心理学所面临的挑战是，要培养敏感性去识别特定的破坏性情绪以及该情绪开启的世界。 

Different moods trigger different mindsets. For example, as a psychologist, I see many clients experiencing ‘neurotic’ anxiety, and I see other clients that experience the anxiety of the pointlessness and meaninglessness of existence. 

不同的情绪触发不同的心态。例如作为一名心理学家，我看到一些来访者，经历"神经质"焦虑，也看到其他来访者经历存在的无意义和荒谬带来的焦虑。

Each form of anxiety emerges out of different moods. I do not work with ‘neurotic’ anxiety in the same way as I work with existential anxiety.

每种形式的焦虑源于不同的情绪。我处理"神经质"焦虑的方式与处理存在焦虑的方式不同。

In my formulation, neurotic anxiety is about mental blocks that inhibit a person from achieving what they wish to achieve, such as a talented musician who feels the frustration of being too scared to perform. 

在我的表述中，神经质焦虑是指阻碍一个人实现心理愿望的心理障碍，例如，一个有才华的音乐家感到害怕表演的沮丧。

In existential anxiety, a person has lost all sense and meaning of being a musician.

在存在性焦虑中,一个人已经完全失去了作为音乐家的意义和方向感。

They are not scared of performing, rather there is a felt sense of a loss of the point of being a musician.

他们不是害怕表演,而是感到作为音乐家的意义和价值感丧失。

Embracing the anxiety of meaninglessness is the clue to working through existential anxiety, while neurotic anxiety is worked through by identifying conflicts within the intrapsychic self.

接纳无意义的焦虑是克服存在性焦虑的关键,而神经质焦虑则通过识别内心自我的冲突来克服

Then there is another kind of alienation and estrangement that leads to a different framing.

此外,还有另一种异化和疏离感,导致了不同的思考框架

For example, bell hooks [writes](https://www.routledge.com/Talking-Back-Thinking-Feminist-Thinking-Black/hooks/p/book/9781138821736) about her feminist thinking arising out of a sense of estrangement from the familiar and taken-for-granted conventions of her cultural context.

贝尔·胡克斯[写道](https://www.routledge.com/Talking-Back-Thinking-Feminist-Thinking-Black/hooks/p/book/9781138821736),她的女性主义思想源于一种对其文化语境中熟悉的、习以为常的习俗的疏离感。

 This alienation allowed her to catch sight of, critique and liberate herself from the dominant patriarchal values. In my psychotherapy practice, I also see men who, in the bewilderment of estrangement, are living through questioning their attunement and ways of being a man, desperately trying to embody new ways of being in relationships.

这种异化使她能够看到、批判并从主导的父权价值观中解放自己。在我的心理治疗实践中,我也看到一些男性,在疏离的迷惘中,正在经历质疑自己的协调性和作为男性的存在方式,拼命尝试在关系中体现新的存在方式。

The point is that there are many forms of mood disruptions, each disclosing a different form of philosophical reflection. It is crucial to develop the ‘phenomenological sensitivity’ to follow the path that arises out of each form of disruption. 

重点是，情绪扰动有多种形式，每一种形式都揭示了不同的哲学反思。 关键要培养"现象学敏感性"，顺着每一种扰动形式产生的璐姐去探索。

Philosophical reflection is about allowing that which emerges in moods of disruption to be made explicit for thought in all its forms: therapeutic reflection, critical reflection, reflexive thinking, thoughtfulness and pondering. Because philosophical reflections work with the moods of disruption, such reflection integrates thought and mood. It is neither subjective nor objective. Thinking always takes place in a mood.

哲学反思就是要让扰动情绪中浮现的东西在各种形式的思考中得以明晰:治疗性反思、批判性反思、反身性思考、深思熟虑和沉思。因为哲学反思与扰动情绪共同运作,这种反思整合了思想和情绪。它既不主观,也不客观。思考总是在某种情绪中进行。
