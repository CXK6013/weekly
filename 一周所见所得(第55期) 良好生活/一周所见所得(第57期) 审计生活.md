[1]  他们就是生活

> Many people view their habits and routines as obstacles or, at the very least, obligations to get through. Making the morning coffee, driving your kids to the next activity, preparing the next meal—we often see our routines as chores to be completed.
>
> 许多人将他们的习惯和日常活动视为障碍，或者是不得不履行的义务。比如，早上煮咖啡，送孩子去参加下一个活动，准备下一餐。我们常常将我们的日常活动当做必须要完成的家务活。
>
> But these are not moments to be dismissed. They are life. Making coffee can be a peaceful ritual—perhaps even a fulfilling one—if done with care rather than rushed to completion. It’s about the amount of attention you devote to these simple moments, and whether you choose to appreciate them or bulldoze through them on the way to the next task.
>
> 但这些时刻不容忽视，他们就是生活，煮咖啡的过程可以是一种平静的仪式，甚至可以是一种充实的仪式，只要你用心而不是匆忙了事，关键在于你对这些简单时刻的关注程度，以及你是选择欣赏它们，还是选择匆匆忙忙地去完成它们，然后去完成下一项任务。
>
> Find the beauty and joy in your daily rituals and you will find beauty and joy in your daily life. To love your habits is to love your days, and to love your days is to love your life。
>
> 在日常仪式中找到美和快乐，你就能在日常生活中找到美和快乐。爱自己的习惯就是爱自己的每一天，爱自己的每一天就是爱自己的生活。

[2]  如何让思想动起来

> An initial period of concentration—conscious, directed attention—needs to be followed by some amount of unconscious processing…the key to solving a problem is to take a break from worrying, to move the problem to the back burner, to let the unwatched pot boil
